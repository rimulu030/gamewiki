However, a major con of group farming is the increased downtime waiting for all players to quit, relaunch, and rejoin the lobby between runs. This can make solo farming more time-efficient overall. If you do choose to group up, coordinating well can make the experience less boring and increase your loot per run.\n\nFor optimizing your loadout for farming speed, it's recommended to use **Light Armor** with a focus on high speed and stamina regeneration. Pair this with the **LIFT-850 Jump Pack** stratagem to improve your mobility, allowing you to traverse the map and obstacles quickly. Other stratagems are less important for farming speed, especially on lower difficulties with low enemy presence.\n\nWhile exploring, keep an eye out for **Minor Points of Interest (POIs)**, which are unmarked locations on the map. You can discover them by getting close, looking for structures, light beams, or destructible doors. These POIs often contain valuable loot like Medals, Super Credits, Samples, and weapons. Activating a Radar Tower objective will reveal all POIs on the map. Additionally, if you encounter the \"Raise Flag of Super Earth\" objective, a contextual stratagem will appear when you are near the flagpole. After calling it in, defend the area while the flag raises. Using the \"Salute\" emote at the flagpole will make the flag rise faster!",

This will help you navigate and loot much faster on subsequent runs on the same map.\n*   **Farming Efficiency:**\n    *   **Time Per Run:** A single run, including quitting and relaunching, takes approximately 3 minutes and 30 seconds.\n    *   **Loot Per Run:** On average, you can expect to get around 30 Super Credits and 8 Medals per run.\n    *   **Estimated Loot Per Hour:** This method can potentially yield over 510 Super Credits and 136 Medals per hour!\n*   **Important Note on RNG:** Keep in mind that your actual earnings can be significantly influenced by Random Number Generation (RNG). This includes factors like the number of POIs on a map and the amount of Super Credits dropped per loot location. Sometimes you might even hit a rare +100 Super Credit jackpot!\n\nThis method is a great way to quickly acquire currency for store items like armor sets, though it's not essential for enjoying the game itself. Happy farming! 💪",

      "evaluation_reasoning": "The answer directly addresses the user's question and recommends the 'Democratic Detonation' Warbond, which is a reasonable suggestion. It provides specific examples of weapons and equipment included in the Warbond and explains why it's a good starting point. However, it misses some key aspects mentioned in the expected answer, such as the 'Cutting Edge' and 'Polar Patriots' Warbonds as strong alternatives. The answer also contains a slight inaccuracy: it mentions the 'BR-14 Adjudicator' which is not part of the Democratic Detonation Warbond. It also mentions the 'CB-9 Exploding Crossbow' which is part of the Steeled Veterans Warbond, not Democratic Detonation. The inclusion of the 'CE-27 Ground Breaker' armor set is correct. Overall, the answer is helpful but could be more accurate and comprehensive.",
