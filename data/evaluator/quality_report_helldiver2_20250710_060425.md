## 主要问题

1. Knowledge base lacks specific details about enemy weaknesses (green belly sacs, armored mouth) and nuances of weapon effectiveness (anti-tank launchers).
2. Retrieval algorithm fails to prioritize chunks containing crucial information about specific enemy weaknesses and behaviors, leading to incomplete and inaccurate answers.
3. Query understanding might be too broad, leading to the retrieval of irrelevant chunks (farming strategies instead of etiquette).
4. Answer generation struggles to synthesize information from multiple chunks effectively, resulting in incomplete answers and potentially incorrect generalizations.
5. Misses the green belly sacs as a weak point.

## 改进建议

1. Expand the knowledge base with more granular details about enemy weaknesses, attack patterns, and weapon effectiveness. Include specific examples and edge cases (e.g., 'Anti-tank launchers are effective against the head, but may not guarantee an instant kill in all situations').
2. Review and refine existing knowledge base entries to ensure accuracy and completeness. Correct any factual errors and fill in missing information.
3. Add keywords and metadata to knowledge base chunks to improve search relevance. Specifically, tag chunks related to enemy weaknesses with keywords like 'weak point', 'vulnerable', 'armor', 'belly sacs', 'armored mouth', etc.
4. Implement a more sophisticated retrieval algorithm that prioritizes chunks based on keyword matching, semantic similarity, and relevance to the specific question being asked. Consider using techniques like BM25F or dense retrieval methods.
5. Fine-tune the retrieval algorithm to penalize chunks that are too general or irrelevant to the specific question. Implement filtering mechanisms to remove irrelevant chunks from the retrieved context.

## 详细评估结果


### 测试用例 1

**问题**: how to kill bile titan

**总体得分**: 8.0/10

**评估理由**: The answer is highly relevant and practical, providing actionable advice on how to kill a Bile Titan. It correctly identifies the head as a weak point and suggests effective stratagems like the Eagle 500kg Bomb and Orbital Laser. The answer also provides HP values for weak points, which is useful. However, it misses the green belly sacs as a weak point and incorrectly states the head can be instantly killed with anti-tank launchers (while possible, it's not guaranteed and depends on the weapon and angle). It also doesn't mention the armored mouth during acid spit. The inclusion of information about the Punisher Plasma and Gas Grenade, while not the primary focus, adds context and demonstrates a broader understanding of the game.

### 测试用例 2

**问题**: how to kill hulk

**总体得分**: 9.0/10

**评估理由**: The generated answer is excellent. It accurately describes how to kill Hulks in the game, focusing on the weak spot (eye) and the use of stun grenades. It also provides additional useful strategies like crippling mobility and disarming the Hulk, which are not explicitly mentioned in the expected answer but are valid and helpful tactics. The answer is well-organized, clear, and easy to understand. The use of emojis adds a bit of flair without detracting from the information. The answer directly addresses the user's question and provides practical advice for defeating Hulks.

### 测试用例 3

**问题**: multiplayer etiquette quick rules

**总体得分**: 3.0/10

**评估理由**: The generated answer is largely irrelevant to the user's question. The user asked for quick rules of multiplayer etiquette, but the answer focuses on efficient farming strategies, loadout optimization for farming, and exploring points of interest. While the information provided might be useful in general, it doesn't address the core request about multiplayer etiquette. The accuracy is low because the answer doesn't provide the specific etiquette rules requested. Completeness is also very low as it misses all the key points in the expected answer. The clarity is relatively high as the writing is easy to understand, but the content itself is off-topic.

### 测试用例 4

**问题**: how to farm samples fast

**总体得分**: 4.0/10

**评估理由**: The generated answer focuses on farming Super Credits and Medals, which are currencies in the game, rather than samples, which are used for upgrading. While the answer is clear and provides a detailed method for farming credits and medals, it completely misses the user's question about farming samples. The information provided is not factually incorrect in itself, but it's irrelevant to the user's query. The answer does provide some practical advice on optimizing runs, but it's ultimately unhelpful for someone trying to farm samples.

### 测试用例 5

**问题**: best warbond to buy first

**总体得分**: 8.0/10

**评估理由**: The answer directly addresses the user's question and recommends the 'Democratic Detonation' Warbond, which is a reasonable suggestion. It provides specific examples of weapons and equipment included in the Warbond and explains why it's a good starting point. However, it misses some key aspects mentioned in the expected answer, such as the 'Cutting Edge' and 'Polar Patriots' Warbonds as strong alternatives. The answer also contains a slight inaccuracy: it mentions the 'BR-14 Adjudicator' which is not part of the Democratic Detonation Warbond. It also mentions the 'CB-9 Exploding Crossbow' which is part of the Steeled Veterans Warbond, not Democratic Detonation. The inclusion of the 'CE-27 Ground Breaker' armor set is correct. Overall, the answer is helpful but could be more accurate and comprehensive.
