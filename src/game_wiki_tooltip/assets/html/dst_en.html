    <!-- Chosen Palette: Don't Starve Earthen Harmony -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: Based on user feedback, this version removes the accordion/collapsible card interaction. All content is now directly visible within each seasonal tab. The structure remains a single-page interface with six main tabs (Start, Autumn, Winter, Spring, Summer, and Post-Year) for clear, high-level organization. Within each tab, content is chronologically organized into phases and presented as static cards. This prioritizes immediate information access and aligns with the user's preferred direct presentation style, making the guide a scannable reference rather than an interactive discovery tool. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        1. Report Info: Seasonal tasks, boss strategies, item crafting priorities. Goal: Guide player actions. Viz/Method: Static info cards (HTML/CSS). Interaction: None (content is always visible). Justification: Aligns with user request for direct content presentation, removing clicks and making all information immediately accessible for quick reference. Library: N/A.
        2. Report Info: Relative importance of core activities per season. Goal: Provide a quick strategic overview. Viz/Method: A stacked bar chart (Chart.js/Canvas). Interaction: Tooltips on hover. Justification: Offers an immediate visual summary of shifting priorities, retained from the previous version as it was effective. Library: Chart.js.
        3. Report Info: Key recipes and boss fight loadouts. Goal: Provide clear, actionable checklists. Viz/Method: Styled HTML tables. Interaction: Static. Justification: Tables are the clearest way to present structured data like recipes and gear lists, aligning with the style of the user-provided `dst_en.html`. Library: N/A.
