    <!-- Chosen Palette: Earthy Neutrals -->
    <!-- Application Structure Plan: This version merges the user's preferred design (V1 tabs) with the required content depth (PDF). The structure is a horizontal tabbed interface for "Autumn," "Winter," "Spring," "Summer," and a new "Post-Year One" section. This provides clear, high-level navigation. Within each tab, the content is meticulously structured to mirror the PDF's chronological phases (e.g., Days 1-10, 11-15), using cards and subheadings. This approach allows users to easily select a season and then drill down into specific, day-by-day instructions without being overwhelmed, perfectly blending usability with comprehensive detail. -->
    <!-- Visualization & Content Choices:
        1. Report Info: All textual content from the PDF. Goal: Present detailed instructions and strategies. Viz/Presentation: Interactive Checklists, styled blockquotes (callouts), and structured text within tabbed sections. Interaction: Click to toggle task completion. Justification: This directly translates the PDF's dense text into an actionable, easy-to-read format. Callouts highlight critical warnings from the source.
        2. Report Info: Data tables (Base locations, Winter gear). Goal: Present comparative data for decision-making. Viz/Presentation: Responsive HTML tables. Interaction: Static. Justification: Makes the PDF's tables web-native and easily accessible within their context.
        3. Report Info: Game progression and phases. Goal: Organize content logically. Viz/Presentation: Horizontal Tabs for major sections (seasons), with vertical sub-sections for day-based phases. Interaction: Click to switch tabs. Justification: This architecture, requested by the user, provides a clear and intuitive navigation path through the game's entire first year and beyond.
