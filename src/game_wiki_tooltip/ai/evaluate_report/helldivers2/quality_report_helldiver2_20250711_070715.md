## 主要问题

1. Knowledge base lacks specific details on certain topics (e.g., armored mouth, green belly sacs, multiplayer etiquette details).
2. Retrieval algorithm fails to identify and retrieve the most relevant chunks for specific queries, leading to missing information and low relevance.
3. Query understanding and rewriting may not be effectively capturing the nuances of the user's intent, resulting in the retrieval of generic information instead of specific details.
4. Answer generation struggles to synthesize information from multiple chunks effectively, leading to incomplete and inaccurate answers.
5. Missing information about the armored mouth during acid spit.

## 改进建议

1. Expand the knowledge base with more detailed information on specific topics mentioned in the common issues, such as the armored mouth, green belly sacs, and specific multiplayer etiquette rules. Focus on adding granular details and examples.
2. Improve the quality of existing knowledge base chunks by ensuring they are accurate, comprehensive, and well-structured. Review and revise existing content to address gaps in information and improve clarity.
3. Enhance keyword tagging within the knowledge base to improve the searchability of specific topics. Ensure that all relevant keywords are associated with each chunk, including synonyms and related terms.
4. Fine-tune the retrieval algorithm to prioritize chunks that are highly relevant to the user's query. Experiment with different ranking strategies, such as semantic similarity, keyword matching, and hybrid approaches.
5. Implement a more sophisticated retrieval strategy that considers the context of the query and the relationships between different chunks. Explore techniques like graph-based retrieval or hierarchical retrieval to improve the accuracy and completeness of the retrieved information.

## 详细评估结果


### 测试用例 1

**问题**: how to kill bile titan

**总体得分**: 7.0/10

**评估理由**: The generated answer is generally helpful and relevant. It correctly identifies the head as a weak point and suggests effective stratagems like the Orbital Laser and 500KG Bomb. The one-sentence summary is a nice touch. However, it misses some key information from the expected answer, specifically the importance of not shooting the mouth while it's spitting acid and the existence of the green belly sacs as a weak point. While the head is a good target, the belly sacs are crucial for stopping the acid attack, which is a significant tactical advantage. The answer also provides HP values for the weak points, which is useful but not essential. The recommendation of anti-tank weapons is reasonable, although the EAT and Quasar Cannon are not explicitly mentioned in the provided context as being effective against Bile Titans, it's a logical inference. The tone is engaging and appropriate for the target audience.

### 测试用例 2

**问题**: how to kill hulk

**总体得分**: 9.0/10

**评估理由**: The generated answer is excellent. It accurately describes how to kill the Hulk enemy in the game, focusing on the weak spot (eye) and providing practical strategies like using stun grenades and targeting the legs/weapon arm. It also suggests useful equipment and stratagems to enhance the player's anti-Automaton capabilities. The answer is well-organized, clear, and directly relevant to the user's question. It goes beyond the expected answer by providing additional helpful information, such as alternative weapons and tactics.

### 测试用例 3

**问题**: multiplayer etiquette quick rules

**总体得分**: 4.0/10

**评估理由**: The generated answer provides general multiplayer tips, but fails to address the specific etiquette rules requested in the prompt. While the information provided is generally accurate and helpful for new players, it misses the core aspects of multiplayer etiquette in the game, such as respecting support weapons, resupply pods, and extraction protocols. The answer is only weakly relevant to the user's query.

### 测试用例 4

**问题**: how to farm samples fast

**总体得分**: 1.0/10

**评估理由**: The answer is completely inaccurate and irrelevant to the user's question. The user asked about farming 'samples,' which are a specific resource in Helldivers 2 used for ship upgrades. The answer instead describes how to farm 'Super Credits' and 'Medals,' which are different resources used for purchasing cosmetics and Warbond progress, respectively. While the answer is clearly written, its complete lack of accuracy and relevance makes it essentially useless to the user.

### 测试用例 5

**问题**: best warbond to buy first

**总体得分**: 7.0/10

**评估理由**: The generated answer is relevant and clear, directly addressing the user's question about the best Warbond to buy first. It correctly identifies Democratic Detonation as a top priority. However, it lacks the depth and detail of the expected answer. While it mentions some weapons and items from the Warbond, it doesn't explain *why* Democratic Detonation is so good (e.g., its ability to destroy objectives without using grenades). It also misses the strong alternatives mentioned in the expected answer (Cutting Edge, Polar Patriots). The accuracy is somewhat questionable as it mentions the BR-14 Adjudicator, which is not part of the Democratic Detonation warbond. The inclusion of emojis enhances clarity and engagement.
