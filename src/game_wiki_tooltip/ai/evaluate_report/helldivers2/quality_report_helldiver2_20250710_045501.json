      "generated_answer": "Hey there, Helldiver! 👋 For your first Warbond purchase, I highly recommend the **Democratic Detonation** Warbond!\n\nThis Warbond is considered the top priority for all players because it offers exceptional value with some incredibly powerful weapons.

It provides a rationale for the recommendation, highlighting key items within the Democratic Detonation Warbond. However, it misses some of the alternative options presented in the expected answer (Cutting Edge, Polar Patriots) and includes the BR-14 Adjudicator which is not in the Democratic Detonation Warbond. The clarity is good, and the tone is engaging. The pro-tip from the expected answer is also missing.",
