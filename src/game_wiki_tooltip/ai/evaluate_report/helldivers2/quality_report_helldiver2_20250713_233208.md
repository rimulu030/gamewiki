## 主要问题

1. Knowledge base lacks sufficient detail on specific weapons, warbonds, and unlock requirements.
2. Retrieval algorithm struggles to identify the most relevant chunks for complex queries involving recommendations, alternatives, and key features.
3. Answer generation fails to synthesize information from multiple chunks into a structured and comprehensive response.
4. Query understanding may not be accurately capturing the user's intent, leading to irrelevant or incomplete results.
5. Inaccurate weapon recommendation (BR-14 Adjudicator)

## 改进建议

1. Expand the knowledge base with more detailed information on each weapon, including its strengths, weaknesses, recommended use cases, and unlock requirements. Include specific details about warbonds, highlighting key selling points and alternative options.
2. Improve the structure of the knowledge base to facilitate easier retrieval of specific information. Consider using a more granular chunking strategy or adding more metadata to each chunk to improve searchability.
3. Experiment with different retrieval algorithms, such as hybrid approaches combining semantic search with keyword-based search, to improve the accuracy and relevance of retrieved chunks. Fine-tune the algorithm's parameters to prioritize chunks containing specific keywords related to the user's query.
4. Implement a re-ranking mechanism to prioritize the most relevant chunks after the initial retrieval. This can involve using a separate model to score the relevance of each chunk based on the query and the content of the chunk.
5. Implement query rewriting techniques to clarify the user's intent and improve the accuracy of the search query. This can involve expanding abbreviations, correcting spelling errors, and adding synonyms to the query.

## 详细评估结果


### 测试用例 1

**问题**: best warbond to buy first

**总体得分**: 7.0/10

**评估理由**: The generated answer is relevant and clear, directly addressing the user's question about the best Warbond to buy first. It recommends "Democratic Detonation" and provides reasons for the recommendation, highlighting specific weapons and items. However, it lacks the structured breakdown of alternatives and key unlocks found in the expected answer, making it less complete. The accuracy is generally good, but it mentions the "BR-14 Adjudicator" which is not actually in the Democratic Detonation warbond. It also doesn't mention the grenade pistol, which is a key selling point of that warbond.
