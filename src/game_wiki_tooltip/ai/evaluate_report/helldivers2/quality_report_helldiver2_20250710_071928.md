## 主要问题

1. Knowledge base lacks specific details about enemy weaknesses and gameplay etiquette.
2. Retrieval algorithm fails to identify and retrieve the most relevant chunks of information.
3. Query understanding may be insufficient to capture the nuances of the user's intent, leading to irrelevant or incomplete results.
4. Answer generation struggles to synthesize information from multiple chunks into a comprehensive and accurate response.
5. Missing the detail about not shooting the mouth while it's spitting acid.

## 改进建议

1. Expand the knowledge base with more granular details about enemy weaknesses (e.g., specific body parts, attack patterns, and corresponding strategies) and comprehensive gameplay etiquette rules (e.g., support weapon usage, resupply pod management, extraction call procedures).
2. Improve the quality of existing chunks by ensuring they are concise, accurate, and cover specific topics in detail. Consider breaking down larger chunks into smaller, more focused units.
3. Review and update the keywords associated with each chunk to ensure they accurately reflect the content and facilitate more effective retrieval. Consider using a controlled vocabulary or taxonomy to standardize keywords.
4. Experiment with different retrieval algorithms (e.g., BM25, dense retrieval using embeddings) and fine-tune their parameters to optimize for relevance and recall. Consider using a hybrid approach that combines multiple retrieval methods.
5. Implement a re-ranking mechanism to prioritize the most relevant chunks after the initial retrieval step. This can involve using a more sophisticated model to score the chunks based on their relevance to the query.

## 详细评估结果


### 测试用例 1

**问题**: how to kill bile titan

**总体得分**: 8.0/10

**评估理由**: The answer is highly relevant and practical, providing actionable advice on how to defeat a Bile Titan. It correctly identifies the head as a primary weak point and suggests effective stratagems like the Eagle 500kg Bomb and Orbital Laser. It also provides HP values for weak points, which is useful. However, it misses the detail about not shooting the mouth while it's spitting acid and the green belly sacs as a weak point to stop the acid attack. The inclusion of the SG-8P Punisher Plasma is a reasonable suggestion for a general loadout, even if not specifically for the Bile Titan. The answer is well-written and easy to understand.

### 测试用例 2

**问题**: how to kill hulk

**总体得分**: 9.0/10

**评估理由**: The generated answer is highly relevant and practical for a player asking how to kill a Hulk in a game. It accurately identifies the weak spot (eye) and provides multiple strategies, including using stun grenades and targeting the legs. It also suggests weapon choices and stratagems, enhancing its usefulness. While it doesn't perfectly match the expected answer in terms of specific weapon recommendations (e.g., Autocannon or Anti-Materiel Rifle), it offers alternative and arguably more comprehensive advice. The clarity is good, with bullet points making the information easy to digest.

### 测试用例 3

**问题**: multiplayer etiquette quick rules

**总体得分**: 2.0/10

**评估理由**: The generated answer is almost entirely irrelevant to the user's question. The user asked for quick rules of multiplayer etiquette, but the answer focuses on farming efficiency and solo vs. group play. While the information provided might be useful in general, it doesn't address the core request about etiquette. The answer fails to mention any of the key etiquette points like respecting support weapons, resupply pods, or extraction calls. The clarity of the writing is good, but the content is off-topic.

### 测试用例 4

**问题**: how to farm samples fast

**总体得分**: 7.0/10

**评估理由**: The generated answer provides a valid strategy for farming *common* samples quickly, focusing on early ship module upgrades. It suggests playing on low difficulty and choosing planets with good visibility. However, it misses the crucial information about farming Super Samples, which requires higher difficulty levels and searching for specific landmarks. While the answer is relevant and practical for early-game progression, it doesn't fully address the user's question of how to farm *all* types of samples fast, especially the rarer ones. The clarity is good, and the breakdown is easy to understand.

### 测试用例 5

**问题**: best warbond to buy first

**总体得分**: 8.0/10

**评估理由**: The answer directly addresses the user's question and provides a clear recommendation for the 'Democratic Detonation' Warbond. It highlights key items and their benefits, making it practical for the player. However, it misses some of the alternative Warbond suggestions and specific reasons for their value as provided in the expected answer. The accuracy is slightly reduced because it mentions the 'BR-14 Adjudicator' which is not part of the Democratic Detonation warbond. It also mentions 'CE-27 Ground Breaker' armor set, which is correct. The overall tone is enthusiastic and helpful.
