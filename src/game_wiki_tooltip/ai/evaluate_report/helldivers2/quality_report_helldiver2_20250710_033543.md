## 主要问题

1. Knowledge base lacks specific and detailed information about enemy weak points and tactics, especially for Bile Titan and Hulk.
2. Retrieval algorithm fails to identify and retrieve the most relevant chunks containing specific weak point information and tactics.
3. Query understanding and rewriting may not be effectively translating user questions into queries that target specific enemy weaknesses and strategies.
4. Answer generation and summarization process may be overly focused on general recommendations rather than extracting and presenting specific details from retrieved chunks.
5. Inaccurate weak point information.

## 改进建议

1. Expand the knowledge base with more detailed information about enemy weak points, including visual aids (if possible), specific weapon recommendations, and step-by-step tactical guides for each enemy, especially Bile Titan and Hulk. Focus on actionable information.
2. Review and refine existing knowledge base entries to ensure they contain specific and accurate information.  Break down large chunks into smaller, more focused chunks that target specific aspects of each enemy (e.g., 'Bile Titan - Weak Point on Abdomen', 'Hulk - Weak Point on Back').
3. Fine-tune the retrieval algorithm to prioritize chunks containing keywords related to 'weak points', 'specific tactics', 'vulnerable areas', and enemy-specific terms (e.g., 'Bile Titan abdomen', 'Hulk back'). Experiment with different embedding models and similarity metrics.
4. Implement a hybrid retrieval approach that combines semantic search with keyword-based search to ensure both relevant and specific information is retrieved.
5. Implement query rewriting techniques to automatically expand user queries with relevant keywords and synonyms related to enemy weaknesses and tactics. For example, if a user asks 'How to beat Bile Titan?', rewrite it to 'What are the weak points of the Bile Titan? What are effective tactics against the Bile Titan?'

## 详细评估结果


### 测试用例 1

**问题**: how to kill bile titan

**总体得分**: 5.0/10

**评估理由**: The answer is relevant to the question but lacks accuracy and completeness. It fails to identify the Bile Titan's specific weak points (forehead plate and green belly sacs) and instead provides general advice about targeting the head or belly, drawing parallels with other enemies. While the suggested weapons and stratagems might be helpful in general, they are not specifically tailored to the Bile Titan based on the provided context. The clarity is good, and the answer is well-structured, but the core information is missing or inaccurate.

### 测试用例 2

**问题**: how to kill hulk

**总体得分**: 3.0/10

**评估理由**: The answer is not accurate in directly addressing how to kill the Hulk. It provides general strategies for dealing with heavily armored automatons but lacks specific information about the Hulk's weak points (eye) and effective weapons like the Autocannon or Anti-Materiel Rifle. While the suggested loadout might be helpful in general combat, it doesn't directly answer the user's question about killing the Hulk. The clarity is good, but the relevance and accuracy are low.

### 测试用例 3

**问题**: multiplayer etiquette quick rules

**总体得分**: 5.0/10

**评估理由**: The generated answer provides some helpful tips for playing the game, such as exploring points of interest and optimizing for speed. However, it misses the core aspects of multiplayer etiquette that the user was asking about, such as respecting teammates' equipment and coordinating extraction. While the information provided is accurate and clear, it's not directly relevant to the user's query about multiplayer etiquette. The answer focuses more on general gameplay tips than the specific rules of conduct expected in multiplayer scenarios.

### 测试用例 4

**问题**: how to farm samples fast

**总体得分**: 5.0/10

**评估理由**: The generated answer focuses on farming Super Credits and Medals, not samples as requested. While the advice is clear and potentially useful for resource gathering in general, it completely misses the mark in addressing the specific question about farming samples. The accuracy is low because it provides information unrelated to the query. Completeness is also low as it doesn't cover any of the expected answer's points about specific missions or sample types. Relevance is moderate because it does address resource farming, but not the specific resource requested. Practicality is decent as the advice could be helpful for new players looking to acquire Super Credits and Medals. Clarity is high as the explanation is well-structured and easy to understand.

### 测试用例 5

**问题**: best warbond to buy first

**总体得分**: 7.0/10

**评估理由**: The answer directly addresses the user's question by recommending the 'Truth Enforcers' Warbond. It provides reasoning for the recommendation, highlighting specific weapons and armor with their benefits. The answer is clear and easy to understand. However, it only focuses on one Warbond and doesn't offer alternative options or a broader perspective like the expected answer. The accuracy is good in that the mentioned Warbond and items are real and have the described characteristics, but it's not the universally agreed-upon 'best' first Warbond, hence the slightly lower accuracy score. It also misses the pro-tip about trying weapons from fallen teammates.
