## 主要问题

1. Knowledge base lacks specific details and sufficient depth on certain topics (e.g., enemy weaknesses, multiplayer etiquette).
2. Retrieval algorithm fails to identify and retrieve the most relevant chunks of information for specific user queries, leading to missing details and irrelevant responses.
3. Query understanding and rewriting may not be effectively capturing the user's intent, resulting in the retrieval of less relevant information.
4. Answer generation struggles to synthesize information from multiple sources and provide complete and accurate answers, especially when dealing with complex or nuanced topics.
5. Missing the detail about targeting green belly sacs to stop acid spit.

## 改进建议

1. Expand the knowledge base with more granular details about enemy weaknesses, including specific tactics (e.g., targeting green belly sacs), and avoidances (e.g., not shooting the mouth while spitting acid).  Ensure each detail is clearly attributed to its source.
2. Add content specifically addressing multiplayer etiquette, covering common scenarios and best practices.  Consider creating dedicated chunks for this topic.
3. Review and improve the quality of existing chunks. Ensure they are accurate, concise, and well-structured.  Consider breaking down larger chunks into smaller, more focused units.
4. Experiment with different retrieval algorithms (e.g., BM25, dense retrieval using embeddings) and fine-tune their parameters to improve relevance.  Consider using a hybrid approach that combines multiple retrieval methods.
5. Implement keyword expansion or query augmentation techniques to broaden the search and capture related concepts.  Use synonyms and related terms to improve recall.

## 详细评估结果


### 测试用例 1

**问题**: how to kill bile titan

**总体得分**: 7.0/10

**评估理由**: The answer is relevant and mostly accurate, providing useful strategies for defeating the Bile Titan. It correctly identifies the head as a critical weak point and suggests effective stratagems like the Eagle 500kg Bomb and Orbital Laser. However, it misses some key details from the expected answer, such as the importance of targeting the green belly sacs to stop the acid spit attack and the specific timing for attacking the head (avoiding the mouth while spitting acid). The provided HP values for weak points are potentially useful but lack source context. The inclusion of Punisher Plasma and Gas Grenades is acknowledged as not directly relevant, which is good. Overall, the answer is helpful but could be more comprehensive and precise.

### 测试用例 2

**问题**: how to kill hulk

**总体得分**: 9.0/10

**评估理由**: The generated answer is highly relevant and practical for a player asking how to kill the Hulk. It accurately identifies the weak spot (glowing red eye socket) and provides effective strategies like using Stun Grenades and crippling mobility. It also suggests disarming the Hulk and offers an advanced strategy for experienced players. The answer is well-organized and easy to understand. While it doesn't explicitly mention the Autocannon or Anti-Materiel Rifle as the *only* weapons, it does recommend the AMR-23, which is a good alternative. The inclusion of other weapon suggestions like the Railgun and Punisher Plasma adds value, even if the Punisher Plasma's direct effectiveness is qualified. The mention of Gas Grenades and Smoke Grenades for crowd control is also a helpful addition.

### 测试用例 3

**问题**: multiplayer etiquette quick rules

**总体得分**: 3.0/10

**评估理由**: The generated answer is not relevant to the user's question about multiplayer etiquette. Instead, it focuses on farming efficiency, which is a different topic. The accuracy is low because it doesn't address the expected answer's points about respecting teammates' equipment and extraction requests. While the answer is clearly written, its lack of relevance and accuracy significantly lowers its overall score. The practicality is somewhat present as it gives advice on farming, but it's not what the user asked for.

### 测试用例 4

**问题**: how to farm samples fast

**总体得分**: 5.0/10

**评估理由**: The generated answer focuses on farming Super Credits and Warbond Medals, which is related to progression but not directly answering the question about farming *samples*. While the answer is clear and provides a practical strategy for farming those resources, it misses the core request. The accuracy is low because it doesn't address the specific types of samples (common, rare, super) and how to efficiently acquire them. It also lacks the specific mission recommendations and difficulty levels mentioned in the expected answer. The completeness is also low as it misses key information about sample farming.

### 测试用例 5

**问题**: best warbond to buy first

**总体得分**: 8.0/10

**评估理由**: The generated answer is highly relevant and practical, directly addressing the user's question with a clear recommendation. It provides a rationale for the recommendation, highlighting key items within the Democratic Detonation Warbond. However, it misses some of the alternative options presented in the expected answer (Cutting Edge, Polar Patriots) and includes the BR-14 Adjudicator which is not in the Democratic Detonation Warbond. The clarity is good, and the tone is engaging. The pro-tip from the expected answer is also missing.
