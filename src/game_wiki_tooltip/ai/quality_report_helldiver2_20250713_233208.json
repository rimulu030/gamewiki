Fine-tune the algorithm's parameters to prioritize chunks containing specific keywords related to the user's query.",

      "generated_answer": "Hey there, Helldiver! üëã For your first Warbond purchase, I highly recommend the **Democratic Detonation** Warbond! üí•\n\nThis Warbond is an absolute must-have for all players and offers incredible value right out of the gate. You'll get your hands on some seriously powerful weapons like the **BR-14 Adjudicator** and the **R-36 Eruptor**, which are fantastic for taking down enemies. Plus, the **CB-9 Exploding Crossbow** is a unique and effective option. Don't forget the **G-12 Thermite** grenade for some excellent area denial and the **CE-27 Ground Breaker** armor set, which is very useful for your loadout.

It recommends \"Democratic Detonation\" and provides reasons for the recommendation, highlighting specific weapons and items. However, it lacks the structured breakdown of alternatives and key unlocks found in the expected answer, making it less complete. The accuracy is generally good, but it mentions the \"BR-14 Adjudicator\" which is not actually in the Democratic Detonation warbond. It also doesn't mention the grenade pistol, which is a key selling point of that warbond.",
